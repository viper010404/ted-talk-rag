Waste was not reduced \u2014 it was eliminated. And the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved.\u201d He also emphasizes that \u201ceconomies run on ideas\u201d and that technological innovation is becoming \u201cmore open, more inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based,\u201d which further benefits people globally.",

Yes, light bulbs. I love my plug-in car. I'd like some solar shingles\" and imagines \"a switch beside the front door, that when you left the house, you could turn off everything except your fridge\" ([1]).  \n- She also recommends lifestyle choices people can adopt: \"eating local, eating lower down the food chain and reducing food waste\" ([1]).  \n- She models individual behavior change with her own choices: \"The biggest part of my personal carbon footprint is my travel... I carefully collect my invitations... and I've transitioned nearly three-quarters of the talks I give to video\" ([1]).  \n- And she emphasizes the power of ordinary people talking about climate: \"The number one thing we can do is the exact thing that we're not doing: talk about it\" ([14]/[19]).\n\nThese passages show the talk addresses both how individuals can change daily habits and how personal conversation/action helps drive larger change.",
