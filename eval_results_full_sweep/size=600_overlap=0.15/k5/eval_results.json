Yes, light bulbs. I love my plug-in car. I'd like some solar shingles.\u201d (context [1]).\n- She lists lifestyle choices people can adopt: \u201ceating local, eating lower down the food chain and reducing food waste, which at the global scale, is one of the most important things that we can do to fix this problem.\u201d (context [1]).\n- She also models practical behavioral changes to reduce personal emissions (e.g., minimizing travel, using video): \u201cThe biggest part of my personal carbon footprint is my travel... I usually don't go anywhere unless I have a critical mass of invitations... and I've transitioned nearly three-quarters of the talks I give to video.\u201d (context [1]).\n- In addition, the talk explains how to talk about climate with others by connecting to shared values so individuals can influence their communities \u2014 \u201cstart from the heart... begin by talking about why it matters to us, to begin with genuinely shared values.\u201d (context [2]).\n\nThese excerpts show this talk combines clear, actionable daily-life tips with guidance on how to engage others \u2014 matching your request for a talk about climate change and what individuals can do.",
