See, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright,\" and later, \"How do we fight it? ... focus on what you can control.

For example, he cites Robert Jensen's study showing that when fishing villages in Kerala got mobile phones, \u201cprices stabilized\u2026waste was not reduced \u2014 it was eliminated. And the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved.\u201d He also notes that \u201cthe work of innovation is becoming more open, more inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based,\u201d so digital tools both raise welfare at the bottom of the pyramid and broaden who can contribute ideas.",

    "response": "I recommend: \"The most important thing you can do to fight climate change: talk about it\" \u2014 Katharine Hayhoe.\n\nJustification from the retrieved TED content:\n- The talk both urges everyday people to act and gives concrete daily-life steps: Hayhoe lists \"simple solutions that save us money and reduce our carbon footprint at the same time. Yes, light bulbs. I love my plug-in car. ... Lifestyle choices: eating local, eating lower down the food chain and reducing food waste\" and even practical habits like a switch to turn off everything when you leave the house and minimizing travel by grouping speaking engagements (context [1]).\n- Beyond actions, the talk focuses on the most accessible individual contribution: conversation. As the transcript states, \"The number one thing we can do is the exact thing that we're not doing: talk about it\" and she explains how to \"start from the heart\" by connecting climate to shared values so people will engage (contexts [14], [2]).\n- Because it pairs specific daily actions with guidance on how to motivate others (talking in ways that connect to values), this talk directly addresses \"what individuals can do in their daily lives.\"",
