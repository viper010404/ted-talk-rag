And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame\" and later, \"vulnerability is not weakness\" and \"vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.\" She also notes TED as \"the failure conference\" \u2014 \"very few people here are afraid to fail\" \u2014 all of which show the talk addresses moving past fear/shame and anxiety.",
