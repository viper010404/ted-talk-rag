As the talk notes, \"the bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology,\" citing Robert Jensen's study of Kerala where mobile phones helped stabilize prices, \"waste was not reduced \u2014 it was eliminated,\" and \"the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved.\" The speaker also emphasizes that innovation is becoming \"more open, more inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based,\" so technology widens who can contribute and benefit.",
