As the speaker puts it, \u201cThese nano\u2011bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications\u2026 [and] they'll also go inside our brain, interact with our biological neurons,\u201d and \u201cwe have the potential to overcome disease and poverty.\u201d The talk\u2019s central claim is that \u201cprogress in technology is exponential, not linear,\u201d and that this accelerating trend can be applied to improve human health, energy and longevity.",

What can you do about the climate crisis?\" He then lists concrete daily-life measures\u2014\"Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. ... Buy a hybrid. Use light rail\"\u2014and urges people to \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life,\" pointing listeners to a consumer-friendly carbon calculator at climatecrisis.net to calculate and reduce their CO2 emissions. He also recommends business and political steps individuals can take (e.g., \"consider making your business carbon-neutral\" and \"Become politically active. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions\"). These parts of the talk directly address climate change and give specific, actionable steps people can take in their daily lives.",
