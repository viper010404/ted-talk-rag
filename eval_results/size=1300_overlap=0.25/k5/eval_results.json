Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (transcript).\n- He explains how to aim for a carbon-neutral life and points to tools: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... It is easier than you think... climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator.\" (transcript).\n- He also covers actions beyond personal consumption: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral\" and urges political engagement: \"Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\" (transcript).\n\nThese passages show the talk addresses both daily personal choices and broader civic/business steps, matching your request.",
