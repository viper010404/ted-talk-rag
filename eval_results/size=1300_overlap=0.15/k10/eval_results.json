Use light rail.\" He also urges lifestyle choices (\"Be a green consumer,\" \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life\" and points listeners to a \"carbon calculator\" at climatecrisis.net), and broader personal steps like making your business carbon\u2011neutral and becoming politically active (\"Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions\"). These specific, practical recommendations in the talk match your interest in daily, individual actions on climate change.",
