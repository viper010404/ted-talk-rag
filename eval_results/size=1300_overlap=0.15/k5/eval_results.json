The speaker says we have \"a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference,\" and describes technology as \"the medium in which we play that infinite game\" of human development.

Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\"\n- He urges consumer and business choices: \"Be a green consumer... Consider making your business carbon-neutral.\"\n- He gives practical tools and next steps: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator... you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\"\n- He also covers civic action people can take: \"Become politically active... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\"\n\nThese lines show the talk focuses on concrete, everyday actions individuals (and businesses) can take as well as resources to implement them, making it the best match in the provided TED data.",
