They say we have \"a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference,\" and describe technology as \"the medium in which we play that infinite game\" of discovering who we are. This frames technology as a force that improves lives by enabling creativity, opportunity and human flourishing (transcript excerpts above).",
