Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\"\n- It encourages lifestyle choices and tools for individuals: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... there is a carbon calculator... You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\"\n- It also covers broader individual engagement: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it... Become politically active.\"\n\nThese lines show the talk focuses on everyday, practical steps people can take and resources to do them. Based on the provided TED content, this is the best match for your request.",
