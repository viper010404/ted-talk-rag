Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (transcript).\n- It gives a clear personal plan: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder... there is a carbon calculator\" (climatecrisis.net).\n- It also covers steps beyond individual habits that people can take in daily life/business: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Invest sustainably\" and urges civic action: \"Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\"\n\nThese passages show the talk directly addresses everyday choices individuals can make (home, transport, consumption, offsets, investing and political engagement), so it fits your request.",
