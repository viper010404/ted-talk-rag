When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless, and we're cowardly.\" And talk_id=70, \"8 secrets of success,\" mentions overcoming self-doubt: \"You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt\" and quotes Goldie Hawn: \"I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough.\" Because the metadata/transcripts provided do not give the speakers' names, I cannot provide the speaker.",

Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (transcript excerpts [2] and [1]).\n- He also urges consumer and business choices: \"Be a green consumer. ... Consider making your business carbon\u2011neutral\" and describes tools to help individuals act: \"There is a carbon calculator\" at climatecrisis.net to calculate and reduce your CO2 (transcript [1]).\n- He includes civic actions that individuals can take: \"Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\" (transcript [1] and [5]).\n\nThese passages show the talk focuses both on practical daily choices (home, transport, consumption) and on political/organizational steps individuals can take, matching your request.",
