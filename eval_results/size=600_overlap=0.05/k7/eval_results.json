Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (context [1], [2]).\n- He also recommends behavioral and lifestyle choices people can adopt: \"Be a green consumer. ... Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life\" and points to tools: \"There is a carbon calculator... you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\" (context [1]).\n- Beyond household tips he covers business and political actions individuals can take: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations... Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions\" (context [1]).\n\nThese passages show the talk both addresses climate change and gives many practical, everyday steps individuals can take, making it the most relevant recommendation from the retrieved TED data.",
