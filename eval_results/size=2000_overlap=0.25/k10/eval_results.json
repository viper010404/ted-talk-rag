He says such tools can go inside the body and brain to diagnose and treat disease, expand human intelligence and increase life expectancy, and that \u201cprogress in technology is exponential,\u201d so these benefits can arrive quickly. (Quotes/paraphrase from the talk: \u201cThese nano\u2011bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications...\u201d and \u201cBut most importantly, it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence...

Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. ... buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (transcript [1]/[2]).\n- It also gives personal- and business-level steps and tools: \"Be a green consumer. ... Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator... you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\" (transcript [1]/[2]).\n- It adds civic and investment actions with direct guidance: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Invest sustainably... Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\" (transcript [2]).\n\nBecause it combines clear, practical daily-life steps, tools (carbon calculator), and broader actions (business, political engagement), this talk best matches your request based on the provided TED content.",
