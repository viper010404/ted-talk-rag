When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless, and we're cowardly.\" (talk_id=97).\n\nBecause the speaker names are not present in the supplied metadata/transcripts, I cannot provide the speaker for these talks based only on the provided TED data.",

For example Gore asks, \"What can you do about the climate crisis?\" and then advises: \"Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.\" He also tells individuals to \"buy a hybrid. Use light rail,\" to \"be a green consumer,\" and to \"make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life\" using the carbon calculator on climatecrisis.net. Beyond personal choices he recommends business and civic actions too: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Invest sustainably... Become politically active. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\" These passages (talk_id=1) show the talk directly focuses on daily-life choices people can make, which matches what you asked for.",
