Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity ... buy a hybrid. Use light rail\" and \"Be a green consumer\" (context [1]).\n- He gives a clear personal plan and tools: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... there is a carbon calculator\" at climatecrisis.net to \"precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce\" (context [1]).\n- He also covers civic and business steps that individuals can influence: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it\" (context [1], [5]).\n\nThese passages show the talk both explains the climate problem and gives many practical, day-to-day actions individuals can adopt.",
