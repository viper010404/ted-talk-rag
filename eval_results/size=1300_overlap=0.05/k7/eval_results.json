Goldie Hawn says, 'I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it.'\"\n- Title: \"The surprising science of happiness\" (talk_id=97) \u2014 the transcript discusses fear explicitly: \"When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless, and we're cowardly.\"\n\nBecause the speaker names for these talks are not present in the provided TED data, I cannot supply the speaker.",

Al Gore asks, \"Now, what can you do?\" and gives concrete steps: \"Reduce emissions in your home. ... Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (transcript excerpts in context [1] and [2]). He also advises: \"Be a green consumer... Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life\" and points listeners to a carbon calculator at climatecrisis.net to \"very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are\" (context [1]). Beyond personal choices he adds civic actions: \"Become politically active. Make our democracy work... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions\" (context [1]). These passages show the talk combines practical, everyday steps with civic and investment advice, making it well suited to your request.",
