Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.\" (talk: Averting the climate crisis)\n- He names routine transport choices: \"Buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (same talk)\n- He urges consumer and business changes people can take immediately: \"Be a green consumer. ... Consider making your business carbon-neutral.\" (same talk)\n- He also proposes an actionable personal goal and tools: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... there is a carbon calculator\" to \"very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\" (same talk)\n\nThese excerpts show the talk focuses both on the climate problem and on concrete, daily-life steps individuals (and small businesses) can take, so it fits your request.",
