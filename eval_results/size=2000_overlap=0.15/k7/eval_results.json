Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" (Transcript [1]).\n- He also advises behavioral and consumer choices: \"Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy... Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.\" and points to practical tools: \"There is a carbon calculator... you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\" (Transcripts [1], [3]).\n- He expands to actions beyond single households that individuals can influence: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations... Invest sustainably... Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it.\" (Transcript [3]).\n\nThese excerpts show the talk focuses both on the problem and on specific, practical steps individuals can take in daily life, making it the best fit from the retrieved TED content.",
