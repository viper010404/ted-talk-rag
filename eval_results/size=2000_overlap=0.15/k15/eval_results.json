Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.\"  \n- He names personal transport choices: \"Buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better.\"  \n- He stresses consumer and lifestyle choices: \"Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy\u2026\" and suggests, \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life,\" noting tools to help: \"There is a carbon calculator... elaborated at climatecrisis.net.\"  \n- He also covers broader, actionable steps individuals can take: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Invest sustainably... Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it,\" and civic engagement: \"Become politically active... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\"\n\nThese passages show the talk focuses both on specific daily actions (home, transport, purchases) and on tools/resources (carbon calculator) and civic steps \u2014 making it the most directly relevant TED talk in the provided data for someone wanting practical, everyday things to do about climate change.",
