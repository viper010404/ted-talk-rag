As the transcript says: \"You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt. Goldie Hawn says, 'I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it.'\"\n\n- (Another example) talk_id=12 \u2014 \"Meet the future of cancer research\" includes a line about fear: \"The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it.\"\n\nIf you can provide speaker metadata or allow use of external sources, I can give the speaker name(s).

Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail. ... Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy...\"\n- He outlines a clear personal goal and tools: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... There is a carbon calculator. ... you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\"\n- He also covers business and civic steps individuals can take: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.\"\n\nIf you also want a talk that emphasizes grassroots, community-level sustainability and making sustainability part of everyday culture, talk_id=53 \"Greening the ghetto\" (which urges democratizing sustainability and using personal influence to push green policies) is a relevant secondary option.",
