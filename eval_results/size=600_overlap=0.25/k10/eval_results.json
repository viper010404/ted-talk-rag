Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.\" He names transport choices: \"Buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" He urges consumer choices: \"Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy,\" and proposes personal carbon management: \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life... There is a carbon calculator\" at climatecrisis.net to \"very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.\" These passages show the talk focuses on practical steps individuals can take in everyday life.",
