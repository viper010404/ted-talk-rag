Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.\" He also recommends transport choices: \"Buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" He urges consumer and business choices: \"Be a green consumer... Consider making your business carbon\u2011neutral.\" He offers a practical tool and steps: \"Make a decision to live a carbon\u2011neutral life... There is a carbon calculator... you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce,\" and to cover remaining emissions \"purchase or acquire offsets.\" He additionally calls for teaching others and political action: \"Become a catalyst of change. Teach others... Become politically active... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions.\" These lines show the talk focuses on both everyday individual actions and practical tools to implement them.",
