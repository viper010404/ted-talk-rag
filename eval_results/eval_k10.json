Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\" He also urges being \"a green consumer\" and even to \"Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life\" using a consumer-friendly carbon calculator at \"climatecrisis.net\" (see passages in the retrieved transcript for talk_id=1). The talk also covers how to make businesses carbon-neutral, invest sustainably, and become politically active to support capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 so it connects individual choices to larger change.
