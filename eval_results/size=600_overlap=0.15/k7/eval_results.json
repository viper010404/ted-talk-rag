Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can\" and \"Buy a hybrid. Use light rail\" (transcript excerpts [1], [3]).\n- It emphasizes consumer choices and lifestyle change: \"Be a green consumer... Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life\" and points listeners to tools: \"There is a carbon calculator\" (transcript [3]).\n- It also covers broader individual steps you can take beyond household choices, including business practices and political engagement: \"Consider making your business carbon-neutral... Become politically active. ... Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions\" (transcript [3], [2]).\n\nThese passages show the talk focuses both on specific daily actions and on how individuals can scale their impact, making it the best match in the provided TED data.",
